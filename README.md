# STAT 545 Homework Assignment 1


### My name is Julian Heavyside, and I'm a grad student in the Zoology Department here at UBC.

I study ecology and evolution of birds and fish, but I like learning about and photographing other animals and plants too, such as this woolly monkey in Peru (*Lagothrix cana*)

and this western redcedar on Vancouver Island (*Thuja plicata*)

## Tasks for this assignment

- [X] create new repo
- [X] edit README.md
- [X] add R Markdown file, and set output to Markdown as well
- [X] do some things to gapminder data in the markdown document
- [X] reflect on feelings

### My process

**README.md file**

After creating my repo, I made a few basic changes to my README.md file in the browser. Then, I created a new RStudio project with version control, and pulled the content of the repo to the local project. I made several more changes (added some photos, changed font size and italicized some things) to the README.md file locally using RStudio, then committed and pushed to github.com

**R Markdown document**

Creating the R Markdown file, and doing some basic exploration of the gapminder dataset was straightforward. I struggled to set the output to include a Markdown file. At first, I tried setting the output to github_document, and I tried setting the output to html_document, with the keep_md: true option added. Finally, I realized I also had to knit the document! One magic click and it all happened. Hopefully that is what you all wanted from me.
