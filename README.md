# This is my repo for the first homework assignment for STAT 545


### My name is Julian Heavyside, and I'm a grad student in the Zoology Department here at UBC.

I study ecology and evolution of birds and fish, but I like learning about and photographing other animals and plants too, such as this woolly monkey in Peru (*Lagothrix cana*)

and this western redcedar on Vancouver Island (*Thuja plicata*)
