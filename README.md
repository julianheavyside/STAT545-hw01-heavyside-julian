# This is my repo for the first homework assignment for STAT 545


### My name is Julian Heavyside, and I'm a grad student in the Zoology Department here at UBC.

I study ecology and evolution of birds and fish, but I like learning about and photographing other animals and plants too, such as this woolly monkey in Peru (*Lagothrix cana*)

and this western redcedar on Vancouver Island (*Thuja plicata*)

## Tasks for this assignment

- [ ] create new repo
- [ ] edit README.md
- [ ] add rmd and md for Gapminder
- [ ] reflect on feelings and stuff

### My process

**README.md file**

After creating my repo, I made a few basic changes to my README.md file in the browser. Then, I created a new RStudio project with version control, and pulled the content of the repo to the local project. I made several more changes (added some photos, changed font size and italicized some things) to the README.md file locally with RStudio, then committed and pushed to github.com

**R Markdown document**
